This is a small console-based utility for getting twitch.tv stream URLs from channel names. The program may also automatically open MPC-HC and start playing the stream. It runs in a loop, so that the user can issue new commands to the program continuously. The program keeps a settings file in the app directory.

I discontinued it when twitch started asking for client ID keys for stream links, since I was not going to register my tiny app with twitch. As of this, the application no longer works, and I have no plans to fix it. The purpose of this repository is mostly for future reference.
